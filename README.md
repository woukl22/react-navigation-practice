# react-navigation-practice
This repo is to practice to use react navigation.

### Problem
- When I use Nesting navigation, it didn't navigate well. I think I should change structure of all navigations.(21.10.17)
- I will use Firebase in this project. I need to learn how to authentication with Firebase and manage data.(21.10.17)


### Structure(21.10.17)
- Main
  - Home
  - Setting
- Authentication
  - BeforeLogIn
  - LogIn
  - SignUp

Problem what I think is Main components and Authentication components is another navigation container. So I think I should combine it.
