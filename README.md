# react-navigation-practice
This repo is to practice to use react navigation.

### Problem
- ~~When I use Nesting navigation, it didn't navigate well. I think I should change structure of all navigations.(21.10.17)~~ (21.10.18 Done)
- ~~I will use Firebase in this project. I need to learn how to authentication with Firebase and manage data.(21.10.17)~~ (21.10.18 Add Login and Signup function)

<br>

### Structure(21.10.17)
- Navigation Stack
  - Main(Tab)
    - Home
    - Setting
  - Authentication(Stack)
    - BeforeLogIn
    - LogIn
    - SignUp
<br>

~~Problem what I think is Main components and Authentication components is another navigation container. So I think I should combine it.~~ (21.10.18 Done)
