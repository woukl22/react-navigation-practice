Introduction
---
I join app development project, so make this repo to practice react native and navigation.<br>
This is only run in snack expo browser.<br>
I don't know why it didn't work another device.<br>
So I'm going to start at first to make it work in every device.<br>

- Use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=ko) for authentication.
- Use [react-native-web-swiper](https://github.com/woukl22/react-native-web-swiper) for Before Login page.
- Study with ['처음 배우는 리액트 네이티브'](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/%EC%B2%98%EC%9D%8C_%EB%B0%B0%EC%9A%B0%EB%8A%94_%EB%A6%AC%EC%95%A1%ED%8A%B8_%EB%84%A4%EC%9D%B4%ED%8B%B0%EB%B8%8C.html?id=nqsXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=ko&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) book and googling.
